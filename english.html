                                    <h3>WHY</h3>

                                    <p>Destroyed medical infrastructure after five years of civil war, a humanitarian embargo and rising numbers of internally displaced people: this is what the current humanitarian crisis looks like in many parts of Syria.</p>

                                    <p>The parts of Syria under Kurdish administration are no exception to this unfortunately. Especially medical equipment, specialized staff and continuous medical care outside urban areas are missing. The same holds true for the region Sinjar in northern Iraq. This remote area currently marks the front line of the so-called Islamic State (IS).</p>

                                    <p>Immediate medical aid is vital. However, the international community seems to lack the will and any concepts to act in that area.</p>

                                    <p>Right from the beginning of our mission in northern Syria and Iraq in 2014 it was clear that sustainable, basic medical care could only be provided through a mobile system.</p>

                                    <p>In 2014/2015 the frontlines were constantly changing. And also today it remains unclear if all parties ofthe conflict would respect permanent medical structures as areas out of bounds for attacks. In the past two years, hospitals have been deliberately chosen as targets by the Syrian and the Russian air force, and also by the Turkish artillery. It seems like all options for survival of the civilians are being taken away.</p>

                                    <p>The only areas that remained untouched by the air raids so far were the Kurdish cantons. Here on the other side fierce battles against the IS and other jihadist militias took place. During their retreat they looted hospitals on their way and transported the captured material to their own areas of control.</p>

                                    <p>The de facto embargo of the Turkish government against the Kurdish areas in Syria seriously impedes the reconstruction of still existing medical structures. You cannot just sneak a X-ray-machine or an OR lamp across the border.</p>

                                    <p>As long as existing hospitals are either specifically targeted in combat or people are prevented from reconstructing them, many more people will suffer and die. We plan to counter this development in the Kurdish administrated areas in northern Syria and Iraq.</p>

                                    <p>With your help we want to senda mobile clinic into these areas. It needs to be mobile in order to provide care also for people outside of urban areas. These are refugees in camps aswell as the often neglected population in remote rural areas. The clinic furthermore needs to be mobile to be able to react to rapidly changing conditions, be it natural disasters or the necessity of a vaccination campaignin a certain area. We also hope that a mobile clinic will mean a reduced risk. Unlike fixed buildings whose coordinates are known, we can change our location in one day. Thereby we hope to avoid becoming a target of bombardment. </p>

                                    <h3>WAS</h3>

                                    <p>Our mobile hospital has three characteristics: </p>

                                    <p>Built for all terrains and for self-sufficiency</p>

                                    <p>The concept of the hospital is to provide maximum effectiveness while taking up minimal space. With this we can reach areas where no one is working (anymore). Furthermore we can react to changing conditions (e.g. new combat sites, internal migration etc.) and move the hospital at short notice.</p>

                                    <p>Through built-in renewable energy supply and grey water recycling the hospital can work self-sufficiently for up to one month. This is especially important in Syria where adequate supplies may not be available. </p>

                                    <p>Support through e-learning and telemedicine</p>

                                    <p>In the near future the mobile hospital will be the center of our already running training program for medical staff in Syria. Not only do we continue our program for training nurses and paramedics, but we have developed the concept further. </p>

                                    <p>The theory part of the program will be supported through e-learning. Medical staff can in between their practical work study and revise the theoretical part at their own pace. A local lack of stable internet will be countered with a cloud-based concept that allows the use of large amounts of data of the training material. Thereby CADUS will become the first provider of medical training material in Kurmanci. Of course the material will also be available in Arabic.</p>

                                    <p>This is accompanied by the first telemedicine project for civil supporters in crisis areas. Through this we try to counter the lack of doctors on the ground. There may at the moment not be many people in Syria that are able to provide help. But at least –through the use of specific technology – we can support those with professional advice that stayed in the area. Medical specialists of different disciplines work in a team to guide through situations of emergency in Syria. The special feature of the telemedicine project is the immediate response: It is possible to provide medical advice in real time as soon as a situation arises on the ground.</p>

                                    <p>Hospital in a box: A new concept of a mobile </p>

                                    <p>Based on 20" shipcontainers, we built an “origami-hospital”. Room extension concepts and innovative logistic solutions together with cheap starting material create anew mobile hospital concept.</p>

                                    <p>In a nutshell:
                                       <ol>
                                          <li>Mobile hospitals are faster ready for use than stationary constructions.</li>
                                          <li>The perfect location does not have to be identified first and reacting to changing conditions like migration is possible.</li>
                                          <li>A wider region can be provided with aid while keeping costs low.</li>
                                       </ol>
                                    </p>

                                    <p>Two types of mobile hospitals already exist: The first one is provided by major organizations (ICRC, RedCross, MSF, the military). They do not have to plan in a resource- or cost-effective way. The second type comes from state institutions. They provide complete solutions like an operating room inside a truck. But these are not made to take care of large groups of people. They are furthermore expensive and therefore not suitable for smaller NGOs or poorer regions/states.</p>

                                    <p>This is the gap that CADUS aims to fill. We want to create an affordable mobile hospital that holds an operating room, a laboratory, imaging diagnostics and ten stationary treatment units.</p>

                                    <p>Through the construction concept with 20” containers, medical modules and structures of self-sufficiency an affordable and sustainable mobile clinic can be built for every region of the globe.</p>

                                    <p>Cost-efficiency and swapbody construction also allow for the mobile hospital to become the center piece of a new stationary hospital. It can be extended piece by piece.</p>

                                    <aside class="image-strip">
                                       <img src="assets/img/foto-1.jpg">

                                    </aside>

                                    <p>The idea of implementing a mobile hospital was born during operations carried out by CADUS in Syria in 2014 and 2015. Since we have received donations we purchased the first truck – a former 4-wheeldrive THW (Federal Agency for Technical Relief) equipment trolley providing a double cabin for our medical team. Furthermore, Berlin-based friends donated a former Medic Shelter from the German Armed Forces. First of all, we started to remove the old device case in order to create space for the Medic Shelter. Currently, we are fixing the egine, gear, axes, brakes and many more in order to make the truck ready for use. </p>

                                    <p>Using this old-model truck, an Iveco Magirus Deutz has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, due to its low operational performance and its simple technology we are able to carry out repairs in any scenario. On the other hand, a lot of spares are unfortunately no longer available and therefore they have to be searched on the parts market or even to be recreated.</p>

                                    <p>However, we think using the Iveco Magirus Deutz is still the right decision.Incorporating simple technology is a crucial decisive criterion for us. Generally, practical experiences of this vehicle type are overall quite good. Various devotees of off-road vehicles decided to make use of this model to build caravans. Moreover, this vehicle type had been frequently used by various fire departments and authorities so that a lot of used items are still available on the parts market.</p>

                                    <p>Within the next two weeks we expect the vehicle to be MOT-proof. After that we will go on reconstructing the double cabin and adapting the Medic Shelter to our needs. The reconstruction works will mostly be implemented on our own and by voluntary supporters because we strongly intend to handle donations responsibly.</p>
